**CLARITY:** is the plot easy to read? is it clear or confusing, are the quantities being visualized ambiguous?  

This plot is of a norm distribution with different means and standard deviations.  For someone who has considerable background knowledge in statistics, this graph would probably be clear to them.  The use of formulas makes it clear how the values are being derived, but it also confuses the point for a viewer who is not well versed in statistics.  Clarity could be improved by labeling values with more meaningful terms, such as using the words standard deviation and mean rather than mew and alpha.  What does the formula as the y-axis label represent? My suggestion would be to determine the purpose of the graph: what are you trying to convey and to whom are you trying to convey it?  Perhaps I am not the target audience, which is why it appears so confusing to me.  The more universal an audience you create your graph for, then the more it can communicate.

**ESTHETIC:** beautiful is a subjective judgment: you should not judge the plot on the basis of whether you think it is "beautiful", but you should judge whether its esthetic is functional to what it is meant to communicate. Are the colors chosen appropriately? Are the graphical elements used appropriate to represent the quantities being visualized? Are the graphical choices allowing you to focus on the right elements or are they distracting you?  

This looks good! I think the horizontal and vertical reference lines look nice and don't overwhelm.  The colors are distinct and stand out.  The font size of the axes lables and tick values are small.  I would suggest increasing the font size.  

**HONESTY:** is the plot honestly reproducing the data or is it deforming it, perhaps to emphasize a point?  

It's honest! But there is no caption explaining.  The graph would be improved if you explained what it is you are attempting to show.
